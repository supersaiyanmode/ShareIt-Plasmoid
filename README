ABOUT

This plasmoid accepts any supported drag-drop data, uploads it to the server
and copies the shortened sharing link (using goo.gl service).

The user must set up his application at google app engine to be able to use
this. Check the 'setting up your server' section for details on how to do this.


SETTING UP

 - Setting up your server
 
    1.  Download and extract google app engine Python SDK from here:
            https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads
        Lets say you have this extracted at ~/gae

    2.  Copy the contents from the Server sub-directory (of the source code)to 
        some location. Lets say ~/server
        
    3.  Create a new app on google app engine. The application-identifier that
        you choose is to be used in the next step.
    
    4.  Open ~/server/app.yaml file. Edit the first line 
            'Application: <your app-id-here>'
        and put in the application-id you just created.
    
    5.  Get your goo.gl shortener api key from here: 
        In the Services pane, activate the Google URL Shortener API; if the
        Terms of Service appear, read and accept them. Next, go to the API 
        Access pane. The API key is in the section titled "Simple API Access."
        Copy the API key, and paste it in ~/server/goo-gl-key
        
    6.  Enter the ~/gae directory and type:
            python appcfg.py update ~/server
        You may need to enter your google account details.
        
    7.  After successful upload, you need to set up your client side.
    
 - Setting up the plasmoid
 
    1.  Create a file: ~/.shareitplasmoid.cfg
    
    2.  Edit the application-id field to match the one you created on google
        app engine like in the following:
            {
                "appid":"<app-id here>"
            }
        
    3.  Install the plasmoid using the following:
            zip -r ~/share-it.zip path/to/Plasmoid-folder
            plasmapkg -i ~/share-it.zip
            
    4.  Add the plasmoid from the 'Add widgets' option from the desktop.
